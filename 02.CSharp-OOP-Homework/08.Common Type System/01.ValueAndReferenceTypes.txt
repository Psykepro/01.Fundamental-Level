1.Value types are these types which contain value in them and they are stored in the stack memory.Reference types contain a pointer for the
object which is stored in the stack.And this pointer is connected with the values of the object which are stored in the heap.

2.When u assign a value type to a variable the variable will get the value.When u assign a reference type
to a variable only the reference (address) is copied and the object stays the same.

3.When value type is passed as argument to a method the method is getting copy of that value.When reference type is passed as argument
to a method the method is getting the original values - the refence of the values.

4.Value types are allocated in the stack.Reference types are allocated in the heap.

5.Data mutation is when u increase a variable.Value types can't be mutated.Reference types can be mutated.

6.When u are mutating a variable u are increasing it.When setting a variable u are making new variable of that type.

7.Out and ref are used to get the refference of the value type or to get the pointer of the pointer of reference type.The difference between them
is that when u use out in method u are obliged to change that variable.
